# Contributor Covenant for a Code of Conduct

## Preamble

In the now-common interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, there 
are certian long-held standards of human decency that are routine boilerplate for
contributors and maintainers, in participation with this and many projects in a 
way that makes for a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, 
body constraints, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, 
religion, and other so-called protected classes.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, and
 other unwelcome attention or advances.
* The above, whether public or private.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate or 
 distracting from the focus of a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Mediation

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at standards@newalexandria.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Details of specific enforcement and mediation policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or support the mediation of the 
Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences 
as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
